# Personal Resume

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Description

This simple personal resume of mine was built to learn a little bit more on CSS styling and to experiment building a responsive/mobile first site.

To view the site, either clone this repo and run in development server, or access via https://personal-resume-e7f91.web.app

## Future Plans

1. Create a blog section to pull https://www.notion.so/ public entries from my personal account (When Notion's API is built)
2. Integrate a chat bot using either Facebook Messenger or DialogFlow
